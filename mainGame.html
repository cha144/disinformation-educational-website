      <h4>Musk shocks everyone once again!</h4>
      <p style="width: 100%;">Today it was officially announced that Elon Musk, previous founder of PayPal and current founder of SpaceX acquired Twitter for a reported price of $120 billion. He also began taking initiative over some of Twitter's workers, firing at least four top Twitter executes including the chief software and chief administration officer. But along with this, Musk has a lot of changes for Twitter in mind. <br> <br> Musk considers himself an free speech absolutist, and has stated that he wished to allow more free speech. Additionally, as a Republican, he aims to make the party more outgoing on Twitter, while also limiting the amount of tweets for opposing parties in order to balance out voter engagement. This would mean that former President Donald Trump would gain access to his previously banned Twitter account again, while current President of the United States Joe Biden would be limited to tweeting 50 times a day. <br> <br> These are not the only changes to be made. Musk has also considered the state of Social Media to be very stale and prefer them all to be under the same parent. As a result, his vision is to have Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat all under Z-Corp, a parent company, by at least 2025. Currently, he has claimed that Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, the company behind Facebook, is looking at a rough $100 billion deal to go with it. It is still unclear on the thoughts of the top heads behind Snapchat but a response is expected in the near future.</p>
